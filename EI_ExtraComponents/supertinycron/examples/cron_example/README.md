# Cron expression parsing example

This example can be used to run cron expression parsing on an Espressif chip.

The example doesn't require any special hardware and can run on any development board.

## Building and running

Run the application as usual for an ESP-IDF project. For example, for ESP32-C3:
```
idf.py set-target esp32c3
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

After launching, the benchmark takes a few seconds to run, please be patient.
