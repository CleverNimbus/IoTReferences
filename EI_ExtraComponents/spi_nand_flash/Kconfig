        help
            If this option is enabled, any time SPI NAND flash is written then the data will be read
            back and verified. This can catch hardware problems with SPI NAND flash, or flash which
            was not erased before verification.

    config NAND_ENABLE_STATS
        bool "Host test statistics enabled"
        depends on IDF_TARGET_LINUX
        default n
        help
            This option enables gathering host test statistics and SPI NAND flash wear levelling simulation.
