# SPI NAND Flash debug example

This example is designed to gather diagnostic statistics for NAND flash, as outlined below:

1. Bad block statistics.
2. ECC error statistics.
3. Read-write NAND sector throughput (both at the lower level and through the Dhara library).
4. Verification of NAND write operations using the Kconfig option `CONFIG_NAND_FLASH_VERIFY_WRITE`.

## How to use example

To run the example, type the following command:

```CMake
# CMake
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example output

Here is the example's console output:
```
